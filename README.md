# leetcode-answers
Hello, this repo contains all my answers to questions listed in leetcode. They're organized first by completed and in progress. Completed problems are organized by posted difficulty while in progress answers are sorted depending on whether a solution was submitted but I want to improve on it or if I have no answer whatsoever yet but still want to push my progress.

The answers are all attempted by me. The nature of these problems means that if I am stumped and look up the solution it's hard to make a solution that doesn't just feel like an imitation of that answer. If that's the case I'll specify it in the comments of the code.

Cheers
<br>
